## AESOP
This is the final project of my time at Flatiron School, as well as my first dive into Redux.  It is meant to communciate with a rails backend, and allows users to create and manage stories and chapters with a richtext format.  After I graduated from Flatiron, I decided to rework this in a major way.  This serves as a timestamp in my development history.
